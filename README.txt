Fun little side project to learn django-rest-framework and React. Eventually I'd like to add Docker, but one thing at a time here.

The purpose of the application is to allow raffles to take place at large events where its difficult for participants to submit their names before hand.

The goal is to eliminate the need for authentication of users, and instead do a session based approach for both a raffle host and the participants.
